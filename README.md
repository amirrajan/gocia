# Hackasm

A Ruby-based compiler for the Hack platform developed in the scope of the NAND to Tetris course(parts [1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris) and [2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2).

## Installation

Clone this repo, install the dependencies required to run the visual part of Gosu framework depending on your system [here](https://github.com/gosu/gosu/wiki). Then run `bundle` and you should be good to go. It is better to use the newer version of ruby like 2.7. It can be installed using [rvm](https://rvm.io/). Once bundle is done you are good to go.

## Usage

You can run the app running the file `./exe/gocia`. It will launch the Gocia window and show you the terrain. To start simulation press `Y`, to go back `T`. `M` turns music on/off. Have fun.

Everyone interacting in the Gocia projectâ€™s codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms and mailing lists is expected to follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/artur-martsinkovskyi/hackasm/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
